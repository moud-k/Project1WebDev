    <p class="animal_page_description">
        Ostriches are large birds that are mainly found in Africa and Australia. Unlike most birds, they are unable to fly, but are able to compensate for 
        their inability to take flight by boasting a speed of about forty-three miles per hour when running on land, which is faster than any other bird. Ostriches 
        are able to use their speed to evade encounters with legitimate predators, and species that they might sense to be predators, like humans. In addition to 
        being the fastest bird on land, ostriches are the heaviest and largest birds. The feathers, skin, and eggs of ostriches are typically used by humans to make 
        clothing, accessories, and food items.
